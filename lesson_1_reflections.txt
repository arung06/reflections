Lesson 1, refelctions
---------------------
R* Viewing a diff between two versions helped me spot the bug because the changes from the old to the new version were only few and i could easily parse through
   them to review the changes and zero-in on the bug.

R* New directory for Git Bash  "c/Users/arung@nvidia.com/git/gitAndGitHub/reflections" (working with normal cmd prompt would be difficult)
  - File lesson_1_reflections.txt

    review the changes and spot the bug.

R* How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
  - One can track exactly when a particular Bug was introduced and revert it accordingly
  - One can revert to earlier better versions easily
  

R* What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
  - Commits might be too big or too small rather than being just right and logically distinct.
  - But commits will be of a work product complete or improved in some sense
  
R* Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
  - Logical changes in code are usually spread over multiple files
  - Docs are usually edited one file at a time.
  
R* How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? 
  - git log -- <filename> # shows all commits that affect the named file
  - git diff <cmt id1> <cmt id2> <filename> # show the diff in the file between two commits
  
R* How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
  - I know i can always go back to a working version of the past very easily
  
R* Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
  - Coding hobby projects
