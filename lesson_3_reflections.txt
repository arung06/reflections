R* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When my local repo has grown in size and i would like to have a back-up of it in the cloud, 
  i would decide to set up a remote repository to which i can back up ll my past and future
  commits.

R* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
   up-to-date with your remote repository?
- I may be evaluating a new feature or fixing a bug that conflicts with commits already on the remote repo
  So a pull may not even happen cleanly.
- I may be operating on a specific topic branch (different from master) for the above purpose. I may choose
  to publish it even as a separate feature branch on the repo

R* Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Cloning is when you replicate a git repo locally from an available URL. The URL itself could point to a remote or local repo.
- Forking is unique to github wherein you "clone" an existing repo on github's servers itself, i.e. from one github account to another account
- Branching involves only a single local repo. It involves choosing a paticular chain of commits. Only one branch can be active for a repo at any given time.
  A repo can have multiple branches to choose from, whether the repo is local or remote

R* What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
   - It helps us to base our new commits on top of the remote's latest state so that there would be no conflicts when we push the commit.
   - The idea is to first pull the latest state from remote, and rebase our commits on top of it and then push our new commits.

R* How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?
   - Without Git or any other VCS, we would periodically be syncing and merging our personal copies of the project using manual diff tools on a file-by-file basis.
     and also be performing functional verification checks to ensure that a relevant subset always works. The project itself may be shared as tarballs over the internet/email.
   - Cons: It would be time-consuming and error-prone to sync-up and merge manually; Root causing and fixing regressions would be harder.
   - Pros: No learning curve involved as in git or github
