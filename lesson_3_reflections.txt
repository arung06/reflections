R* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When my local repo has grown in size and i would like to have a back-up of it in the cloud, 
i would decide to set up a remote repository to which i can back up ll my past and future
commits.

R* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay
   up-to-date with your remote repository?
- I may be evaluating a new feature or fixing a bug that conflicts with commits already on the remote repo
  So a pull may not even happen cleanly.
- I may be operating on a specific topic branch (different from master) for the above purpose. I may choose
  to publish it even as a separate feature branch on the repo
