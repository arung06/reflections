Lesson 2, refelctions
---------------------
R* What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  - An empty branch called master is created
  - There are no commits in the git log
  - .git directory is created
  - We need to do it to start tracking files under a directory in git VCS

R* How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
   - Staging area can hold files that are part of the logical problem that are complete while other pieces/files are  
     still in progress in the working directory
   - It prevents or flags inadvertent edits to finalized files  
   - No inadvertent commits can be made.

R* How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

R* What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

R* How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

R* What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

R* What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
